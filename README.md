# 538Riddler2-22
The Code I used to solve the riddler express

It uses a brute force approach to solve this riddler.  Trying all possible number combinations then printing the result once it finds one that matches all the criterea.  It is "hard-coded" to work with a 3 x 7 grid, but could theoretically be programmed to work with any row/column combination by adding some parameters to the functions.
