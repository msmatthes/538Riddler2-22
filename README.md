# 538Riddler2-22
The Code I used to solve the riddler express

It uses a brute force approach to solve this riddler.  Trying all possible number combinations then printing the result once it finds one that matches all the criterea.  It can work rows and colums <= 1 to find any combinations that work with the numbers.
